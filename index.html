        <h2>"I would prefer to lose my life rather than to stay alive with a wound in my heart..." (W.Pilecki)
        </h2>
        <p>Unbreakable soldier, cursed soldier, a soldier of the “Lost Republic of Poland”, “a volunteer to Auschwitz”,
            one of the six bravest men of the European resistance movement during
            World War II. He is the symbol of Poland, which – as the result of the actions of the Soviet Russia and Nazi
            occupation – has been irretrievably lost. He belonged to the pre partition generation, whose mission was to
            regain independence by Poland and when it happened – work for the free homeland. He was an intelligence
            agent and resistance leader. He served as a cavalry officer in the Polish Army in the World War II. Pilecki
            was also a co-founder of the Secret Polish Army resistance
            group. He was the author of Witold's Report, the first
            comprehensive intelligence report on the atrocities committed at the Auschwitz concentration camp.
            Volunteering for Ausch­witz and ­remaining there for almost three years was the most courageous thing
            Pilecki ever did, perhaps one of the most courageous things anyone has ever done. But it was not his only
            deed of bravery, and not the one that killed him. At war’s end in 1945, Pilecki made for Italy, to report to
            the command of a Polish Army that had helped the Americans and the British defeat the Germans.“The
            Ausch­witz Volunteer,” the document we are now so
            fortunate to have, was composed in Italy, just before his return to Poland, because he suspected
            that he would not survive.
            The Soviet re-entrance into Poland brought with it the progressive installation of a Communist regime.
            Pilecki returned to his homeland in October 1945 to report on the takeover, but in 1947 the Polish Communist
            secret police arrested him. Before his trial, he was tortured, but he didn’t reveal any names.
            He was accused of illegal border
            crossing, use of forged documents, not enlisting with the military, carrying illegal arms and espionage for
            General Władysław Anders. Pilecki called his actions legal and in the true interest of Free Poland. He was
            sentenced to death and executed with a shot to the back of the head on 25 May 1948.

            <h2>'Can one pick and choose when one wants to come to Auschwitz and when one wants to leave?' Pilecki
                replied: “One can.”
            </h2>

            <div class='hell2'>
                <p> Pilecki’s plan was simple. He would get himself arrested, get thrown in Auschwitz and then start
                    gathering and smuggling out intelligence about the place. In September 1940 the 39-year-old Polish
                    cavalry officer, a member of the Polish
                    resistance organisation Tajna Armia Polska (Secret
                    Polish Army, TAP, later known as Armia Krajowa or Home Army) deliberately walked into a
                    German roundup in Warsaw, and was sent by train to the new German
                    camp. His astounding choice was made within, and for, Poland’s anti-Nazi underground.
                    His superiors provided him with a false identity card in the
                    name of "Tomasz Serafiński". He was
                    the only known person ever to volunteer to be imprisoned in Auschwitz.</p>

                    <p>In the camp Pilecki was known as Tomasz Serafiński (Prison Number 4859) and began the work of
                        organising the Związek Organizacji Wojskowej. ZOW would become the Auschwitz branch of
                        Armia Krajowa and its aims were, inter alia, to improve inmate morale, provide news from
                        outside,
                        and set up intelligence networks. ZOW was organized in a
                        cell
                        network of "Fives". Each five agents knew nothing about their comrads. By 1941 ZOW had
                        grown with "High Five" creating sub-groups. The organisation had its own system of
                        enforcing order (with a secret
                        criminal court). Thanks to civilians living nearby, the
                        organisation received medical supplies. Inmates even constructed a radio receiver and hid it in
                        the camp hospital.
                        By spring of 1942, the organization had over 1,000 members, including women.</p>

                        <p> Pilecki was assigned to a night shift at a camp bakery outside the fence. He and two
                            comrades (Jan Redzej and Edward Ciesielski) overpowered a guard, cut the phone line, and
                            escaped on the night of 26/27 April 1943, taking with them documents stolen from the
                            Germans. The men fled on foot to the village of Alwernia where they were helped by a
                            priest, and then on to Tyniec where locals assisted them. After that they reached the Polish
                            resistance safe house near Bochnia, owned, coincidentally, by commander Tomasz
                            Serafiński—the very man whose identity Pilecki had adopted for his cover in Auschwitz.
                            At one point during the journey, German soldiers attempted to stop Pilecki, firing at him as
                            he fled; several bullets passed through his clothing, while one struck him without hitting
                            either bones or vital organs.

        <h2>Why did not they tell me about you before?</h2>
        <p>For decades, his story was unknown and supressed, due to Soviet censorship at the time. They couldn't speak
            about his anti-Nazi actions without telling of his anti-communist activities too. In 1990, Witold Pilecki
            was finally absolved of all charges. Pilecki’s comprehensive 1945 report on his undercover mission at
            Auschwitz was published in English for the first time in 2012, under the title 'The Auschwitz Volunteer:
            Beyond Bravery'. After the war, Poland was occupied by Soviet forces and a Communist government installed.
            Pilecki insisted on fighting on against this second occupation but he was captured, put on trial, executed
            and all traces of his wartime record destroyed or locked away in the vaults. His family only learnt details
            of his mission to Auschwitz in the mid-1990s. Since then his story has slowly emerged.

            One of his famous quotes is:

            “I cannot live. They killed me. Because compared to them (Communists) Auschwitz was just a trifle.”
